                        <h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive rock, sometimes simply referred to as prog rock. It is one of 
                        the branches of rock music that emerged in the late 1960s. Its connotation is very complex and absorbs 
                        many other features of other music genres, so it is hard to clearly define it in musicianship. The most 
                        pinnacle of prog rock was in the early 1970s and it continues to this day. Prog rock originated in the 
                        United Kingdom. Most of the groups appeared in Europe, and only a few bands came from the United States 
                        and Canada. This style of this genre usually combines musical elements such as jazz, classical music, folk 
                        music and world music, which is unlike American rock that is influenced by R & B and country music. After 
                        years of evolution, prog rock has also developed many branches such as symphony rock, art rock, mathematical 
                        rock, and prog metal.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prog rock musicians intend to get rid of the formulation and constrains of popular 
                        music genres, and strive to discover new possibilities of their own music, even if they often largely influenced 
                        by classical music and jazz. The most unique part of prog rock is "complexity" in arrangement and narrative rather 
                        than simply playing technique.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no absolute definition of prog rock. Robert Fripp, the representative figure of the famous band King Cirmson, 
                        hates this term in music classification. Most of the works that have constructed prog rock are concentrated in the 1970s, 
                        such as: Jethro Tull, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rush, Queen and King Crimson, have different 
                        characteristics. These musicians and critics are questioning whether they really belong to prog rock. </p>

                        <h1>Proto-prog (1967-1969)</h1>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the music of this era listed blow is not strictly prog rock, their experiments 
                        in the field of music have directly brought the musicianship of rock to a new level. During this period, the 
                        bands have done many breakthrough experiments on the combination of sound processing, instrumental performance, 
                        new recording technology and diversified music styles, which has gradually inspired prog rock.</p>
                        <h3>1. The Beatles - Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatles is a great band because their contributions to rock are incomparable. Their 
                        experiments on rock have never stopped. This is a psychedelic and a well-known rock album.</p>
                        <h3>2. Pink Floyd - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pink Floyd is the originator of psychedelic rock, one of the founding bands of 
                            prog rock. This is Pink Floyd's first album, which means the beginning of the psychedelic rock era.</p> 
                        <h3>3. The Moody Blues - Days of Future Passed (1967)</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This album is a combination of psychedelic rock and symphony. It is made collaboratively 
                            by Moody Blues and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. This is a work that cannot be style-oriented 
                            at the time, a mixed product.</p>
                        <h3>4. Caravan - Caravan (1968)</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also an important band. They and Soft Machine established the Canterbury 
                            classification in Prog Rock. The album mixes Jazz elements and psychedelic rock, and for the first time, 
                            the important idea of conceptual in album composition is put forward.</p>
                        <h3>5. Giles Giles & Fripp - The Cheerful Insanity of Giles Giles & Fripp (1968)</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This album is not mature enough to be a good album or a fundation of a music genre, but it is the very 
                            start of King Crimson's legendary giutarist Robert Fripp's career.</p>

                        <h1>Peak Years (1971â€“76)</h1>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 10, 1969, an album with long-length works, variable-beat performances, 
                            the use of the Mellotron electronic keyboard and symphony, and lyrics covering the universe and philosophy
                            which are most of the prog rock elements, was born. This may be the first prog rock album in the history. 
                            That is King Crimson's In The Court of the Crimson King. They were the pioneer for the style of prog rock. 
                            The cover of the album is an illusionary face with a wide open mouth. This famous cover was designed by British 
                            artist Barry Godber, who was only 23 years old at the time. However, it is a pity that he suffered from heart 
                            disease and passed away in the following year.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Crimson's first album, which combines psychedelic rock, string music, electronic 
                            music components, experimental Jazz, Melotron electronic keyboards, new recording technology, and even a little 
                            metal and Folk composition shows a very competitive and aggressive new music genre -- prog rock.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, some other former rock bands also started their unique creations and 
                            inventions. The more well-known bands include Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc. A few years later, countless 
                            prog rock bands will think of these pioneering bands as their enlightenment bands.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bands above are just the tip of the iceberg of the prog rock bands that emerged in the 1970s, 
                            because during that period, the prog rock bands were booming worldwide. Kansas, Styx from the United States, and Supertramp 
                            from the United Kingdom established the Art Rock category with that simple and popular form of music. Germany bands like 
                            Can, Faust, and Neu! established German prog rock -- Kraut Rock with their electronic style. French has bands such as Clearlight and 
                            Mona Lisa, which focused on melody and atmosphere.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the mid and late 1970s, there was a more independent and more aggressive music style 
                            than the prog rock exists. That is punk rock. Punk rock was the direct consequence of the decadence of prog rock. After 1975, 
                            the space for prog rock to survive has been gradually reduced, almost to a precarious point. Some bands have been forced to 
                            change their music style to adapt to the new music trend, but there are also some prog rock artists in order to maintain the 
                            prog rock style, and their own dignity. They began to prepare for the second wave of aprog rock music.</p>

                        <h1>Age of Decline (1980-1989)</h1>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the punk rock wave swept in 1977, the market environment for most prog rock bands was quite harsh. 
                            Prog rock has become an optional marginal culture. Some bands such as Genesis and Yes have slowly transformed their music style. 
                            They have survived by adding more works with commercial elements. Some experienced musicians have found a balance between 
                            prog rock and commercialization and do a good job. Of course, there are bands like King Crimson who continue to stick to the 
                            Style of prog rock.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prog rock always have loyal audiences, so there would still be some young people joining the prog rock 
                            field and continue exploring. With the efforts of these new bands, the second wave of prog rock was born. This wave is called 
                            neo prog. Among them, the most famous bands are probably Rush, Marillion and IQ.</p>
                        <h3>Rush</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush is the founder of the prog metal, because Rush's conceptual heavy-metal-style performance. The 
                            bass technique of Geddy Lee and Neil Peart's drum percussion have influenced countless later prog metal bands and musicians. 
                            Rush was formed in the late 1960s. From their 1976 album 2112, they officially entered the field of prog rock.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush released three important works in the early 80s, which are Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures 
                            and Signals. These excellent works contain a rigorous prog rock style and a little bit commercial elements, which laid a 
                            solid foundation for prog metal.</p>
                        <h3>Marillion</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marillion is one of Neo Prog's most famous bands and was originally formed by drummer Mick Pointer. 
                            After guitarist Steve Rothery and lead singer Fish joined in, the band officially changed its name to Marillion. In 1982, 
                            Marillion released their first album. Many people will compare them with Genesis, because when peeople first listen to Fish, 
                            they will feel that his voice is similar to Genesis' Peter Gabriel in many ways. Then drummer Mick Pointer left the band, Ian 
                            Moseley took his place, and Marillion released a timeless classic album, Misplaced Childhood, in Neo Prog history in 1985. 
                            In 1988, Fish officially left Marillion, and Steve Hogarth became the new lead singer of the band. With the change of the new 
                            lead singer, Marillion's style changed.</p>
                        <h3>IQ</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Marillion, IQ is the most successful british neo prog band in the 1980s. In fact, IQ and 
                            Marillion are still slightly different in style. IQ's playing style is more atmospheric and its instrumental performance is more 
                            attractive. They released their first album in 1983. The band's lead singer Peter Nichols left the band in 1985, but returned to 
                            IQ in 1993. The other two members of IQ, keyboard player Martin Orford and Bass player John Jowitt, are also very tanlented.</p>

                        <h1>New Age (1990-now)</h1>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revival of prog rock in the 1980s was not successful, only few band are remembered by the masses. 
                            However, since the 1990s, the  prog rock spirit has begun to return, and more and more musicians with outstanding ideas have 
                            appeared. The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard take the idea of prog rock to the extreme. At the same time, as another product 
                            of the development of rock, metal has also begun to find a place in prog rock. Excellent bands such as Dream Theater and Pain 
                            of Salvation have taken prog metal to a whole new level.</p>
                        <h3>The Flower Kings</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roine Stolt of The Flower Kings is really an excellent guitarist and composer who created many beautiful 
                            melodies. In 1993, Roine Stolt founded The Flower Kings. The band is very prolific. They tend to releases an album almost every 
                            year, sometimes 2CDs, but without affecting their music quality.</p>
                        <h3>Dream Theater</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream Theater is today's most famous and influential prog metal band, their 1992 album Images & Words 
                            clearly established the conception of prog metal. Dream Theater's music combines the strong rhythms that heavy metal should have, 
                            organized melody, and extremely intricate arrangements. Since most members of the band were graduated from the conservatory, they 
                            rely on a solid music philosophy and instrumental playing foundation. They developed the prog metal to a position that almost 
                            reached its peak. The members of the band are also famous for their obsession with solo, because almost every member of the bands 
                            has almost reached the highest level in the field of instruments they play. Guitarist John Petrucci, drummer Mike Portnoy, and 
                            keyboardist Jordan Rudess made an experimental extension of the concept of prog metal in the The Perfect Element Part I and Part 
                            II released in 1998 and 1999. The addition of the fusion element makes prog metal more diverse.</p>
                        <h3>Pain of Salvation</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain of Salvation, formed by Daniel Gildenlow, is onr of the most alternative prog metal band. Many times, 
                            people will feel that their style is outside the prog metal. They have done many conceptual attempts in their albums, sometimes 
                            along with Gothic elements. Their style has gradually changed over time. As a non-traditional prog metal band, they have occupied 
                            a place in the prog metal.</p>
