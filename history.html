                        <h1>Background and roots</h1>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and 
                        American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, 
                        the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the 
                        vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the "progressive"
                        pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such 
                        as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. 
                        The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: "we got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, 
                        so we tried to get into something else. Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're 
                        all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." Rock music started to take itself seriously, 
                        paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with 
                        audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression 
                        that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the "underground" 
                        and the "establishment" for listening publics.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegarty and Halliwell identify the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Doors, 
                        the Pretty Things, the Zombies, the Byrds, the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd "not merely as precursors 
                        of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days". According to musicologist 
                        Walter Everett, the Beatles' "experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts" on their 
                        albums Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966) "encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create 
                        progressive rock in the early 1970s". Dylan's poetry, the Mothers of Invention's album Freak Out! 
                        (1966) and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) were all important in progressive 
                        rock's development. The productions of Phil Spector were key influences, as they introduced the 
                        possibility of using the recording studio to create music that otherwise could never be achieved.
                        The same is said for the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966), which Brian Wilson intended as an 
                        answer to Rubber Soul and which in turn influenced the Beatles when they made Sgt. Pepper.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan introduced a literary element to rock through his fascination with 
                        the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the 
                        early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf 
                        and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan 
                        also led the way in blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such 
                        as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies 
                        inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental 
                        virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, 
                        would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.

                        <h1>Proto-prog and psychedelia</h1>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to AllMusic: "Prog-rock began to emerge out of the British 
                        psychedelic scene in 1967, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, 
                        Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues (Days of Future Passed)." The availability of newly 
                        affordable recording equipment coincided with the rise of a London underground scene at 
                        which LSD was commonly used. Pink Floyd and Soft Machine functioned as house bands at all-
                        night events at locations such as Middle Earth and the UFO Club, where they experimented with 
                        sound textures and long-form songs. Many psychedelic, folk rock and early progressive bands were 
                        aided by exposure from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Jimi Hendrix, who rose to prominence in the 
                        London scene and recorded with a band of English musicians, initiated the trend towards virtuosity 
                        in rock music. The Scottish band 1-2-3, later renamed Clouds, were formed in 1966 and began performing 
                        at London clubs a year later. According to Mojo's George Knemeyer: "some claim [that they] had a vital 
                        influence on prog-rockers such as Yes, The Nice and Family."<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symphonic rock artists in the late 1960s had some chart success, including the singles 
                        "Nights in White Satin" (the Moody Blues, 1967) and "A Whiter Shade of Pale" (Procol Harum, 1967). 
                        The Moody Blues established the popularity of symphonic rock when they recorded Days of Future 
                        Passed together with the London Festival Orchestra, and Procol Harum began to use a greater variety 
                        of acoustic instruments, particularly on their 1969 album A Salty Dog. Classical influences sometimes 
                        took the form of pieces adapted from or inspired by classical works, such as Jeff Beck's "Beck's Bolero" 
                        and parts of the Nice's Ars Longa Vita Brevis. The latter, along with such Nice tracks as "Rondo" and 
                        "America", reflect a greater interest in music that is entirely instrumental. Sgt. Pepper's and Days 
                        both represent a growing tendency towards song cycles and suites made up of multiple movements.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several bands that included jazz-style horn sections appeared, including Blood, 
                        Sweat & Tears and Chicago. Of these, Martin highlights Chicago in particular for their experimentation with 
                        suites and extended compositions, such as the "Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon" on Chicago II. Jazz influences 
                        appeared in the music of British bands such as Traffic, Colosseum and If, together with Canterbury scene 
                        bands such as Soft Machine and Caravan. Canterbury scene bands emphasised the use of wind instruments, 
                        complex chord changes and long improvisations. Martin writes that in 1968, "full-blown progressive rock" 
                        was not yet in existence, but three bands released albums who would later come to the forefront of the music: 
                        Jethro Tull, Caravan and Soft Machine.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "progressive rock", which appeared in the liner notes of Caravan's 1968 
                        self-titled debut LP, came to be applied to bands that used classical music techniques to expand the styles 
                        and concepts available to rock music. The Nice, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Pink Floyd all 
                        contained elements of what is now called progressive rock, but none represented as complete an example of the 
                        genre as several bands that formed soon after. Almost all of the genre's major bands, including Jethro Tull, 
                        King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, ELP, Gentle Giant and Renaissance, released their debut 
                        albums during the years 1968–1970. Most of these were folk-rock albums that gave little indication of what 
                        the band's mature sound would become, but King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King (1969) was a fully 
                        formed example of the genre. Critics assumed the album to be the logical extension and development of late 
                        1960s work exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. According to Macan, 
                        the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallising the music of earlier bands "into 
                        a distinctive, immediately recognizable style".

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the genre's major bands released their most critically acclaimed albums 
                        during the years 1971–1976. The genre experienced a high degree of commercial success during the early 
                        1970s. Jethro Tull, ELP, Yes and Pink Floyd combined for four albums that reached number one in the US charts, 
                        and sixteen of their albums reached the top ten. Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973), an excerpt of which was 
                        used as the theme for the film The Exorcist, sold 16 million copies.<br>
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive rock came to be appreciated overseas, but it mostly remained a European, 
                         and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the 
                         genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is at 
                         least in part due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also 
                         involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation 
                         in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as 
                         the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, 
                         the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie 
                         Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which 
                         British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success 
                         of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive rock achieved popularity in Continental Europe more quickly than it did 
                        in the US. Italy remained generally uninterested in rock music until the strong Italian progressive rock scene 
                        developed in the early 1970s. Few of the European groups were successful outside of their own countries, with 
                        the exceptions of bands like Focus, who wrote English-language lyrics, and Le Orme and PFM, whose English lyrics 
                        were written by Peter Hammill and Peter Sinfield, respectively. Some European bands played in a style derivative 
                        of English bands. The "Kosmische music" scene in Germany came to be labelled as "krautrock" internationally and is 
                        variously seen as part of the progressive rock genre or an entirely distinct phenomenon. Bands such as Can, which 
                        included two members who had studied under Karlheinz Stockhausen, tended to be more strongly influenced by 
                        20th-century classical music than the British bands, whose musical vocabulary leaned more towards the Romantic 
                        era. Many of these groups were very influential even among bands that had little enthusiasm for the symphonic variety 
                        of progressive rock.

                        <h1>Decline and fragmentation</h1>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political and social trends of the late 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s 
                        hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's development and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the 
                        utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of 
                        purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's 
                        nergy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged 
                        into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music was not part of the marketing 
                        strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market 
                        niches.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four of progressive rock's most successful bands – King Crimson, Yes, ELP and Genesis 
                        – went on hiatus or experienced major personnel changes during the mid-1970s. Macan notes the September 1974 
                        breakup of King Crimson as particularly significant, calling it the point when "all English bands in the genre 
                        should have ceased to exist". More of the major bands, including Van der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant and 
                        U.K., dissolved between 1978 and 1980. Many bands had by the mid-1970s reached the limit of how far they 
                        could experiment in a rock context, and fans had wearied of the extended, epic compositions. The sounds of the 
                        Hammond, Minimoog and Mellotron had been thoroughly explored, and their use became clichéd. Those bands who 
                        continued to record often simplified their sound, and the genre fragmented from the late 1970s onwards. In 
                        Robert Fripp's opinion, once "progressive rock" ceased to cover new ground – becoming a set of conventions to 
                        be repeated and imitated – the genre's premise had ceased to be "progressive".<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment 
                        and limited control over their content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s.[113] Corporate artists and 
                        repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount of control over the creative process that had previously belonged to 
                        the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer 
                        changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric 
                        Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing 
                        for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style 
                        of arena rock.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few new progressive rock bands formed during this era, and those who did found that 
                        record labels were not interested in signing them. The short-lived supergroup U.K. was a notable exception 
                        since its members had established reputations; they produced two albums that were stylistically similar to previous 
                        artists and did little to advance the genre. Part of the genre's legacy in this period was its influence on other 
                        styles, as several European guitarists brought a progressive rock approach to heavy metal and laid the groundwork 
                        for progressive metal. Michael Schenker, of UFO; and Uli Jon Roth, who replaced Schenker in Scorpions, expanded the 
                        modal vocabulary available to guitarists. Roth studied classical music with the intent of using the guitar in the 
                        way that classical composers used the violin. Finally, the Dutch-born and classically trained Alex and Eddie Van 
                        Halen formed Van Halen, featuring ground-breaking whammy-bar, tapping and cross-picking guitar performances that 
                        influenced "shred" music in the 1980s.

                        <h1>Commercialisation</h1>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some established artists moved towards music that was simpler and more commercially 
                        viable. Arena rock bands like Journey, Kansas, Styx, GTR, ELO and Foreigner either had begun as progressive 
                        rock bands or included members with strong ties to the genre. These groups retained some of the song complexity 
                        and orchestral-style arrangements, but they moved away from lyrical mysticism in favour of more conventional themes 
                        such as relationships. Genesis transformed into a successful pop act, and a re-formed Yes released the relatively 
                        mainstream 90125 (1983), which yielded their only US number-one single, "Owner of a Lonely Heart". These 
                        radio-friendly groups have been called "prog lite". One band who remained successful into the 1980s while maintaining 
                        a progressive approach was Pink Floyd, who released The Wall late in 1979. The album, which brought punk anger 
                        into progressive rock, was a huge success and was later filmed as Pink Floyd – The Wall.

                        <h1>Post-punk and post-progressive</h1>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punk and prog were not necessarily as opposed as is commonly believed. Both genres 
                        reject commercialism, and punk bands did see a need for musical advancement. Author Doyle Green noted that 
                        post-punk emerged as "a kind of 'progressive punk'". Post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references 
                        of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined rock as "progressive", 
                        "art", or "studio perfectionism". In contrast to punk rock, it balances punk's energy and skepticism with art 
                        school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. World music, especially 
                        African and Asian traditions, was also a major influence. Progressive rock's impact was felt in the work of 
                        some post-punk artists, although they tended not to emulate classical rock or Canterbury groups but rather Roxy 
                        Music, King Crimson, and krautrock bands, particularly Can.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "post-progressive" identifies progressive rock that returns to its original 
                        principles while dissociating from 1970s prog styles, and may be located after 1978. Martin credits Roxy 
                        Music's Brian Eno as the sub-genre's most important catalyst, explaining that his 1973–77 output merged aspects 
                        of progressive rock with a prescient notion of new wave and punk. New wave, which surfaced around 1978–79 with 
                        some of the same attitudes and aesthetic as punk, was characterised by Martin as "progressive" multiplied by 
                        "punk". Bands in the genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than the punks, and there were 
                        crossovers, such as Fripp and Eno's involvement with Talking Heads, and Yes' replacement of Rick Wakeman and 
                        Jon Anderson with the pop duo the Buggles. When King Crimson reformed in 1981, they released an album, 
                        Discipline, which Macan says "inaugurated" the new post-progressive style. According to Martin, Talking Heads 
                        also created "a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and 
                        progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is 
                        clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well."
