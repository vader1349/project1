        <h2>How you believe you have met the expectations listed above?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Content:<br>
                Most of the text contents are created original(home page, history page , and band introduction), 
                using the references from Wikipedia and my own opinions about these bands and their music.
                The images are all within the public domain or free to use with the license.
                Three form pages, links to other sites, eleven separate pages, favicon and animation are included.
            </li>
            <li>Coherence and Contrast:<br>
                The images I choose match the theme, which are photos of the bands and album covers. 
                They are appropriately sized. the elements are basically center-aligned. The style is maintained across the whole site.
                There are three different fonts assigned to the main texts, the title of the pages and sub-titles of the contents.
            </li>
            <li>Client-mindedness:<br>
                The site is totally created to the client, who are prog rock fans or beginners. It fits well on both mobile and desktop screens. 
                There is a menu for navigation. All the images are attached with proper alt attributes.
            </li>
            <li>Project Organization:<br>
                Images, CSS and JS files are all external. External files are all organized into folders. 
                Classes and IDs are used correctly.
            </li>
            <li>Technical Soundness:<br>
                Filenames are in lower case. The site served over HTTPS on port 8443. Files are readable and passed the validator of w3school. 
                (<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a>, <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>)
                The site is created without the aid of other libraries or frameworks. There is a regular workflow in GitHub.
            </li>
